\begin{itemize}
\item[\normalsize(a)]
better, because a more flexible way will fit the large sample size better.
\item[(b)]
worse, it might overfitting.
\item[(c)]
better, the more parameters, the more degree of freedom, a flexible model can fit the data well.
\item[(d)]
worse, if we use more flexible model on the situation, it might increase variance.
\end{itemize}

\Large{2.}
\begin{itemize}
\item[\normalsize(a)]
\normalsize regression, inference.\\[2ex]
Because the CEO salary is quantitative output and we want to know the relationship between two features, so we use regression to make the inference.\\[2ex]
n - $500$ firms in the US.\\
p - profit, number of employees, industry.
\item[(b)]
classification, prediction.\\[2ex]
The "success" and "failure" is a qualitative output and we want to predict new product's success or failure, so we use classification to make the prediction.\\[2ex]
n - $20$ similar products previously launched.\\
p - price charged, marketing budget, comp. price, ten other variables.
\item[(c)]
regression, prediction.\\[2ex]
The percentage of change in US dollar is quantitative output and we want to make a prediction, so we use regression to make the prediction.\\[2ex]
n - $52$ weeks of $2012$ weekly data.\\
p - $\%$ change in US market, $\%$ change in British market, $\%$ change in German market.

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{bias-variance-decomposition}}
\item[(b)]
Because each index is larger than $0$, so each of five curves has the shape displayed in the figure.

\normalsize
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
i. Iris dataset\\
Response：Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica\\
Predictors：length and width of sepal and petal.\\
$\bullet$ Prediction.Because we want to predict the species of iris.\\[2ex]
ii. Race\\
Response：European, Asian, American, African\\
Predictors：height, weight, complexion.\\
$\bullet$ Prediction.We want to classify the race.\\[2ex]
iii. Stock market price direction\\
Response：up, down\\
Predictors：price movement of each day in last week\\
$\bullet$ Prediction.We just predict the Stock market price direction is up or down.
\item[(b)]
i. Salary\\
Response：Salary\\
Predictors：years of education, industry experience, Nature of the work\\
$\bullet$ Inference.We build the function to explore the relationship between the features. \\[2ex]
ii. House price\\
Response：House price\\
Predictors：region, population, GDP\\
$\bullet$ Inference.Reason is the same as (i.).\\[2ex]
iii. Test score\\
Response：Test score\\
Predictors：reading time\\
$\bullet$ Inference.Reason is the same as (i.).
\item[(c)]
i. Cancer type.\\
ii. City or country.\\
iii. Youtube video recommendations.

\begin{itemize}
\item[i.]
\ \\
Advantages：Obtaining a better fit for non-linear models, decreasing bias.\\[3ex]
Disadvantages：Large number of parameters, overfitting, increasing variance.
\item[ii.]
\ \\
When we are interested in prediction and not the interpretability of the results.
\item[iii.]
\ \\
When we are interested in inference and the interpretability of the results.
